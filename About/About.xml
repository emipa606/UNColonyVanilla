Update of Sadjuuks mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2443851003

- Since I already have a mod named UN-Colony, I renamed this to reflect that it uses vanilla resources
- Added a loft-version of the log bed, wooden bed and the steel bed if [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2961708299]Loft Bed[/url] is loaded

- Warning this mod is a completely revised version and is not compatible with the old ones of UN-Colony or UN-Furniture
- I use Realistic Darkness and Combat Extended, it can have an impact on how the lights and wall's HP are set
- Feel free to make your suggestions for additions or adjustments
- A big thanks to Mlie for his work on previous versions and on all the Mlie's resurrected mods !
- Feel free to use the mod as you want, but if you can put a link to your mod here in comments and a link of this mod in your description it's perfect !
- The mod can be added to current saves since it only adds new things with vanilla mecanics only

[h1]Hope you will enjoy ![/h1]
