- Since I already have a mod named UN-Colony, I renamed this to reflect that it uses vanilla resources

- I use Realistic Darkness and Combat Extended, it can have an impact on how the lights and wall's HP are set
- Feel free to make your suggestions for additions or adjustments
- A big thanks to Mlie for his work on previous versions and on all the Mlie's resurrected mods !
- Feel free to use the mod as you want, but if you can put a link to your mod here in comments and a link of this mod in your description it's perfect !
- The mod can be added to current saves since it only adds new things with vanilla mecanics only

# Hope you will enjoy !
